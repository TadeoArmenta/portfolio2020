# portfolio2021
Portfolio for 2021, uses Chester template Â© 2020 NuclearThemes
It is an original work of [Patrick Finnigan](https://github.com/patrickfinnigan).

I've used this to practice some MERN/MEVN stack and with AWS services.

The idea is to create a branch for each practice and use them to demonstrate my skills on each one.
